# Drum Kit

## In this small project I used JavaScript code on this HTML page, along with DOM manipulation, and the result was the creation of a battery. It became an interactive experience, allowing the user to play different drum sounds by pressing corresponding keys on their keyboard or clicking on the virtual drums displayed on the web page. You can check out the battery implementation on my GitHub page:
